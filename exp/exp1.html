        //My program takes a small array then expands the array to 100 so that I do not have to write the entire array out. Next my program examines each member of the array and determines if it is divisable by 3 or 5. If it is divisable by 3 it prints Fizz, if it is divisable by 5 but not 3 it prints Buzz. Otherwise it prints the number of the array.

        var n = [1];

        //Sequence: first expand array
        //Loop: second expand array to 100 by counting to 100 by adding count and 1
        for(i=0; i<100; i++){
            n.push(i+1);
        }

        //Sequence: second check if members of array divisable by 3 or 5 and then for each one that is print Fizz or Buzz
        //Loop: Check each individual member of array.
        for(i=0; i<n.length; i++){

            //Selection: See if a member of an array is (1) divisable by 3 if it is print Fizz, (2) divisable by 5 if it is print Buzz, (3) if it is neither print the member of the array.
