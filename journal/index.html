                <h2>Overlay Design Patterns</h2>

            <p>I enjoyed learning what patterns to avoid when designing overlays. One of the biggest hurdles to overcome with overlays is navigation. Clearly communicating how users can escape from an overlay is no easy task. Explaining CTAs, adding a close button, and using the ‘Escape’ key all are ways to enhance navigation on an overlay.</p>

            <p>Other suggestions are to keep the browser window from scrolling if the overlay scrolls. Even considering using a separate webpage instead of an overlay can enhance a user's experience. I learned that overlays should be purposeful and should only be used to communicate urgency and importance.</p>

            <p>To learn more about overlay design patterns check out the article I read <strong>Kathryn Whitenton's</strong> article “Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes” [<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">website</a>].</p>

            <p>One suggestion from the article above that intrigued me was using the browser's back button to close the overlay and lightbox. I researched how I might include this in my designs and found a forum on <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> [<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69440276/how-can-i-use-the-browser-back-button-for-closing-an-overlay">website</a>].</p>

            <p>Interestingly the article mentioned that I could create a push state when the overlay opens and then edit the browser's history with Javascript which would allow users to use the back button to close the overlay.</p>

                <h2>Form Design</h2>

            <p>There are many ways a design can optimize form usability, in effect, increasing conversions so that users do not leave the form. Some quick fixes would lower cognitive overload by breaking the form into multiple steps, using a vertical layout for both mobile and desktop, and asking the easy questions first.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, autofocusing the first input field helps users to find the starting location. I did a bit of research into how one can use autofocus on a field. <strong>Stack Overflow</strong> [<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/277544/how-do-i-set-the-focus-to-the-first-input-element-in-an-html-form-independent-fr">website</a>] mentions multiple methods one can apply auto focus to a form. One of the easiest is by simply using the autofocus attribute in the input tag in the HTML.</p>
            <p>An important detail to form design, listed in the article below, is not putting default text, errors, or labels in the input itself. This is important because users can forget what they were supposed to type in the input. Using very specific explanations in the error message around the input helps the users to understand what they need to do.</p>
            <p>To learn more about form design check out <strong>Medium</strong>’s “Best practices for form design” [<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">website</a>].</p>
            <p>One example of the best practices in form design is the Request a Visit Form on <strong>jw.org</strong> [<a href="https://hub.jw.org/request-visit/en/request">website</a>]. When a user fills out the form wrongly the errors specifically state what the user is missing and then highlights where the input fields that caused the error.</p>
                
            <p><strong>JW.org</strong> also automatically selects the language and location that best suits the user by including a default value in the drop down menu. And because the site has over 1000 languages, they correctly use the drop down menu to enhance language selection.</p>
